# livecodeLottery
Old Monopoly program I made in school.
Make sure you have LiveCode installed to run.

.txt files must be stored in a file called .monopoly on /Desktop/ (unless this is altered and depending on OS)

Fair warning this program is most likely the worst you could do this project but it works!
Missing several features of the actual game, which you can add in if you so desire.
